# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict sales for Big Mart outlets based on historical sales data, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to forecast sales based on various features like product type, outlet size, and other relevant factors. The model is built using Python and utilizes XGBoost for regression.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing sales trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built using the XGBoost regression algorithm for predicting sales.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: For numerical computations
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualizations
- `sklearn`: For data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation
- `xgboost`: For building the regression model
